# Jenkins Freestyle Project Implementation Report

## Project Overview

This report documents the creation of a Jenkins Freestyle project with GitHub integration and automated webhook triggers. All steps include verification checkpoints and the actual outcomes.

## Prerequisites

- **Jenkins Server**: The project was executed on a server running at `http://your-server-ip:8080`.
- **GitHub Account**: A GitHub account with repository creation permissions was used.
- **Network Access**: The Jenkins server was configured to be accessible from GitHub webhooks.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Jenkins Freestyle Job Creation

#### **Step 1.1: Accessed Jenkins Dashboard**

First, I navigated to the Jenkins URL, logged in with admin credentials, and verified the dashboard displayed successfully.

_Expected: Main dashboard with "New Item" visible in left menu_

#### **Step 1.2: Created New Freestyle Project**

A new project was started by clicking **"New Item"**. I entered the job name `my-first-job`, selected **"Freestyle project"**, and clicked **"OK"**.

_Expected: Job creation form with name field and project type selection_

#### **Step 1.3: Performed Initial Job Configuration**

On the configuration page, I added the description "First Jenkins freestyle project for CI/CD automation" and saved the configuration, leaving the other settings at their defaults.

![Job Configuration Page](screenshots/job-config-initial.png)
_Expected: Configuration page with multiple sections (General, Source Code Management, Build Triggers, etc.)_

#### **Step 1.4: Verified Job Creation**

Returning to the dashboard, `my-first-job` was visible in the project list with an initial status of "Never built".

_Expected: Dashboard showing newly created job in project list_

### 2. GitHub Repository Setup

#### **Step 2.1: Created GitHub Repository**

I logged into GitHub and created a new repository named `jenkins-scm`, initializing it with a README file.

![GitHub Repository Creation](screenshots/github-repo-creation.png)
_Expected: New repository with README.md file visible_

#### **Step 2.2: Copied Repository URL**

The HTTPS URL for the new repository (`https://github.com/username/jenkins-scm.git`) was copied for use in the Jenkins configuration.

![Repository URL](screenshots/github-repo-url.png)
_Expected: Repository page with clone URL visible_

### 3. Connecting Jenkins to GitHub

#### **Step 3.1: Configured Source Code Management**

In the `my-first-job` configuration, I navigated to the **"Source Code Management"** section, selected **"Git"**, and pasted the copied repository URL. The **"Branch Specifier"** was left as `*/main`.

![SCM Configuration](screenshots/jenkins-scm-config.png)
_Expected: Git configuration section with repository URL filled_

#### **Step 3.2: Tested Repository Connection with a Manual Build**

After saving the SCM configuration, I initiated a manual build by clicking **"Build Now"** from the job page.

![Manual Build Execution](screenshots/manual-build-execution.png)
_Expected: Build #1 appears in build history_

#### **Step 3.3: Verified Build Success**

I checked the **"Console Output"** for the first build and confirmed that the repository checkout was successful.

_Expected: Console showing successful Git clone and checkout completion_

## Sample Console Output from Manual Build:

The following output confirms a successful connection and checkout from the GitHub repository.

```

 > git config core.sparsecheckout
 > git checkout -f abc123def456
Commit message: "Initial commit"
First time build. Skipping changelog.
Finished: SUCCESS
```

### 4. Configuring Automated Build Triggers

#### **Step 4.1: Enabled GitHub Webhook Trigger in Jenkins**

In the `my-first-job` configuration, under the **"Build Triggers"** section, I checked the box for **"GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"** and saved the change.

![Build Triggers Setup](screenshots/build-triggers-webhook.png)
_Expected: Build Triggers section with GitHub webhook option enabled_

#### **Step 4.2: Configured Webhook in GitHub**

In the GitHub repository's **Settings**, under **"Webhooks"**, I added a new webhook. The configuration was as follows:
   - **Payload URL**: `http://jenkins-ip:8080/github-webhook/`
   - **Content type**: `application/json`
   - **Events**: "Just the push event" was selected.
   - **Active**: The webhook was set to active.

![GitHub Webhook Configuration](screenshots/github-webhook-config.png)
_Expected: Webhook configuration form with Jenkins payload URL_

#### **Step 4.3: Tested the Automated Trigger**

To test the webhook, I edited the `README.md` file directly in the GitHub repository and committed the change to the main branch.

![GitHub File Edit](screenshots/github-file-edit.png)
_Expected: GitHub file editor with changes ready to commit_

#### **Step 4.4: Verified Automatic Build**

Upon returning to the Jenkins dashboard, a new build for `my-first-job` had been triggered automatically by the push to the GitHub repository.

_Expected: New build (#2) appears automatically in build history_

## Troubleshooting Guide

This section documents potential issues and their resolutions based on the implementation.

### **Issue**: Job Creation Fails

**Symptoms**: Error message when clicking "OK"
**Solutions**:

- Verify Jenkins has sufficient disk space
- Check job name contains only valid characters (letters, numbers, hyphens)
- Restart Jenkins service if persistent issues occur

### **Issue**: GitHub Repository Not Accessible

**Symptoms**: "Failed to connect to repository" error
**Solutions**:

- Verify repository URL syntax: `https://github.com/username/repo.git`
- Check repository visibility (public vs private)
- Configure GitHub credentials in Jenkins if repository is private
- Test network connectivity: `curl -I https://github.com`

### **Issue**: Build Fails with Git Errors

**Symptoms**: Console shows Git command failures
**Solutions**:

- Verify Git is installed on Jenkins server
- Check branch name matches repository default branch
- Ensure Jenkins user has Git access permissions
- Clear workspace and retry build

### **Issue**: Webhook Not Triggering Builds

**Symptoms**: Manual builds work, but GitHub pushes don't trigger builds
**Solutions**:

- Verify webhook URL format: `http://jenkins-ip:8080/github-webhook/`
- Check Jenkins server accessibility from internet
- Confirm webhook shows green checkmark in GitHub
- Review webhook delivery logs in GitHub settings
- Ensure firewall allows inbound traffic on port 8080

### **Issue**: Webhook SSL/TLS Errors

**Symptoms**: GitHub webhook delivery fails with SSL errors
**Solutions**:

- Use HTTP instead of HTTPS for initial testing
- Configure proper SSL certificates on Jenkins
- Add GitHub IPs to firewall whitelist
- Test webhook delivery manually from GitHub interface

### **Issue**: Build Queue Stuck

**Symptoms**: Builds remain in queue without executing
**Solutions**:

- Check Jenkins executors availability
- Verify no jobs blocking the queue
- Restart Jenkins service if needed
- Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
