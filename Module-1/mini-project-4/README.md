# Pull Requests & Merging in Git

## üéØ Objective

This document explains the concepts and process of creating Pull Requests (PRs) and merging branches in Git. It is designed to help to understand how to contribute changes to a shared repository, collaborate with others, and maintain a clean and organized codebase. This includes creating PRs, reviewing changes, resolving merge conflicts, and finalizing the merge process.

## üîÑ What is a Pull Request (PR)?

A **Pull Request** (PR) is a way to propose changes to a codebase. It allows developers to notify team members about changes they've pushed to a branch in a repository, usually with the intention of merging into the `main` or `development` branch after review.

8. Pull Latest Changes

```

‚ö†Ô∏è Resolving Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts:
```sh

Always branch off from the latest main or develop.

Keep PRs focused and small.

Write clear PR titles and meaningful descriptions.

Review code carefully before merging.

Delete stale branches after merging to keep the repo clean.
